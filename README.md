# IdleTwitch
A simple idle twitch bot for drops.

CHANGELOGS:
-> Added the `getUserProperty` which parses the content of the `twilight-user` cookie to get any property
-> Added the name at the login to know if the auth_token is the correct one
-> Changed the interface for windows cmd's
-> Added animated cli spinners for more readability
-> Added some colors
-> Added a check for the drop, by going to the inventory page (switched from directly accessing the notifications tab to make it simpler) (originally thought by MajesticMarshmallow)
-> Added the choice to specifically choose a game to watch drops for
-> Added some error handling with custom error messages
->
